# Home Data Logger

A data logger built using Arduino hardware and used to record temperatures and distances (using ultrasoninc module). The start point  for the is the Jaycar wifi environmental data logger kit https://www.jaycar.com.au/wifi-datalogger.

## Software Libraries

The RTClib (https://github.com/adafruit/RTClib) needs to be added for the data logger shield.
